Mizar_FLA.*    ..... The FSFE Fiduciary License Agreement modified for Mizar (AMU)


Comments:
 
JU: I now think there should be two versions of the AMU FLA: one
    allowing only free open source relicensing, and another one
    allowing also parallel commercial relicensing. I think it might be
    good to allow AMU to provide commercial licensing in special and
    important cases, however I also think that some authors might not
    agree with me. It would be bad to lose such authors for the (very
    likely needed in the future) changes of the free licensing. Note
    that for example Arxiv also allows the authors to select between
    several licenses when submitting. We would allow them to choose
    between two FLAs. Practically, we will now dual-license under GPL
    and CC-BY-SA.
