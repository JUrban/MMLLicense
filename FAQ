Who owns the MML?

The owner, as far as copyright is concerned, of the MML is the SUM
(Association of Mizar Users). However, the MML permits other people to
use and redistribute the MML, under some conditions.

Each contributor also gets special permission to do anything he
wished, without any condition, with his own contribution.


Who can use the MML?

Anybody can use the MML for any purpose whatsoever without any
restriction nor obligation, as long as "use" does not include
redistributing (giving a copy) of the MML, or any article using the
MML, to any third party.

"Using" the MML typically entails using definitions / theorems /
schemas / notations / ... from the MML to write new proofs, or to
modify definitions / proofs / ... in the MML.


What do I have to do if I want to redistribute the MML, or part
thereof, unmodified?

You have to inform the people you give the MML to of their rights and
obligations. Specifically, include the files COPYING.* in the copy you
redistribute. You may not forbid other people to exercise the rights
given to them by the SUM.


What do I have to do if I want to redistribute the MML, or part
thereof, modified or augmented?

1) Add to the header of the file:

   Copyright © YEAR_OF_MODIFICATION YOUR NAME <your_email@example.org>

   If your employer owns your work, that would be:

   Copyright © YEAR_OF_MODIFICATION YOUR_EMPLOYER <employer_email@example.org>

2) You have to give others the same rights you got, that is you have
   to license your modifications and your new articles under the GNU
   GPL v3 (or later), the Creative Commons BY-SA v3 (or later), or
   (preferably) both.

   If your employer owns your work, this requires his/her permission.

3) Include the files COPYING.* in what you redistribute.


What do I have to do if I want my enhancements to go into the
"official" version of the MML, distributed by mizar.org?

1) Sign the Fiduciary Licensing Agreement, if you have not already
   done so.

   If you live in France, sign the FLA again even if you did so in the
   past.

2) Update the copyright line to include the current year. E.g. for
   modifications you did in 2010, change

   or

   For new articles, put in the header:

   Copyright © 2010 Association of Mizar Users
                         (Stowarzyszenie Uzytkownikow Mizara, Białystok, Poland).

3) Send the FLA, along with your enhancements to the MML, to the Mizar
   project.


Can I write and distribute a program that has the MML inside (as a
parse tree, as a memory dump, ...) and have that TODO non-free?

TODO: no, unless program is GPL/CC-BY-SA itself.
